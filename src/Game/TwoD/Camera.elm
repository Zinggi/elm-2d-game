type Size
    = Width Float

    | Area Float
    | Custom (( Float, Float ) -> ( Float, Float ))


{-| A camera represents how to render the virtual world.
It's essentially a transformation from virtual game coordinates to pixel coordinates on the screen.
-}
type Camera
    = Camera { size : Size, position : ( Float, Float ) }


{-| A camera that always shows `width` units of your game horizontally.
Well suited for a side-scroller.
-}
fixedWidth : Float -> ( Float, Float ) -> Camera
fixedWidth w pos =
    Camera { size = Width w, position = pos }


{-| A camera that always shows `height` units of your game vertically.
Well suited for a vertical scroller.
-}
fixedHeight : Float -> ( Float, Float ) -> Camera
fixedHeight h pos =
    Camera { size = Height h, position = pos }


{-| A camera that always shows the same area.
This is useful in a top down game.
You probably want to specify the area as a multiplication of width and height:

    fixedArea (16*10) (x, y)

This means the camera will always show 160 square units of your game.
In practice, this means that on a 16:10 viewport, 16 by 10 units of your game will be visible.
But on a 4:3 viewport it would show 14.6 by 10.95 units. (sqrt(16*10*4/3)=14.6, sqrt(16*10*3/4)=10.95)

-}
fixedArea : Float -> ( Float, Float ) -> Camera
fixedArea a pos =
    Camera { size = Area a, position = pos }


{-| The custom camera allows you to use a function
that maps viewport size (in pixel) to game units.
E.g. here's an implementation of the fixedWidth camera using custom:

    fixedWidth width =
        custom (\( w, h ) -> ( width, width * h / w ))

-}
custom : (( Float, Float ) -> ( Float, Float )) -> ( Float, Float ) -> Camera

    Camera { size = Custom fn, position = pos }


{-| Gets the transformation that represents how to transform the camera back to the origin.
The result of this is used in the vertex shader.

            ( x - w, x + w, y - h, y + h )
    in

{-| Given the screen size, gets the width and height in game units
-}

        Width x ->

-}

{-| Move a camera to the given location. In *absolute* coordinates.
-}
moveTo : ( Float, Float ) -> Camera -> Camera
moveTo pos (Camera camera) =
    Camera { camera | position = pos }


{-| Smoothly follow the given target. Use this in your tick function.

    follow 1.5 dt target camera
